# 🦠 Soupvivors
A microbial survival strategy game... inside a bowl of soup.

## 🌡️ You are a bacterial lifeform that spontaneously emerged in a hot soup.
Your goal: evolve into sentient intelligence before the host throws you away.

## 🧫 Each day is a chance to grow, mutate — or perish.
Pick your soup — 🥣 Borscht, 🍜 Miso, or 🌶 Tom Kha — and survive with whatever ingredients it gives you.

## 🧬 Features:

Evolve from microbe to sentient species 🧠

Limited mutations (max 5) — choose wisely

Random events: freezing, fermentation, oxygen loss

Unpredictable end: the soup could be discarded at any moment

## 🎮 Actions:

[1] Expand Biomass — increases XP, consumes resources

[2] Stimulate Mutation — trigger a mutation (accept or reject)

Next Day — pass time, with chances for spontaneous effects

## 🥘 Soup types:

🟥 Borscht: stable, rich, slow-paced

⬜ Miso: light, fast, oxygen-rich, unstable

🥥 Tom Kha: spicy, chaotic, mutation-friendly

## 🧵 Every run is a new micro-story.
Will your civilization achieve consciousness before the soup is poured down the drain?

All ASCII bacteria are handcrafted. No AI was harmed during fermentation.
